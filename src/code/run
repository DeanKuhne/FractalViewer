colorScan Class :
There are 4 methods in the colorScan class, each method can create a new index color model by inputing 
the number of color. To create new color model, we used RGB model, and modifying the value of red, blue and 
green ( which are all ranges from 0 to 255), and combining to create the color for a specific pixel. The number of color
will be used as the size of arrays of red, blue and green. By looping those arrays, a certain value will be created and
transfered to bytes. 
To instantiate the index color model, we input 8 bits, create the size as large as the number of color, and RGB parameters.

For createRedAlphaColorModel method, the value of alpha, which is ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 is added, and combined 
to form a new method. The final input parameters to create index color model will add alpha array.
